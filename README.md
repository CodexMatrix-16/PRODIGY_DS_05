# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 5:

# Accident Data Analysis

# Overview

-  This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and contributing factors. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to provide insights into accident hotspots and conditions.

# Key Analysis Steps

-  Dropped columns with high missing values to improve data quality.
-  Conducted EDA to explore accident frequency across cities, states, years, and weather conditions.
-  Created visualizations to highlight accident trends and distributions.

# Key Insights

-  Miami recorded the highest number of accidents, while Star Junction and Stromsburg had the least.
-  California reported the most accidents, whereas South Dakota had the least.
-  The year 2021 had the highest accident rates.
-  Most accidents occurred during fair weather conditions, suggesting that other factors like driver behavior or congestion may play a bigger role than weather.

# Conclusion

-  The analysis highlights accident hotspots and trends that can help guide policy decisions, urban planning, and road safety measures to reduce accidents.
